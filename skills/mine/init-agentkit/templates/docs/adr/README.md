# Architecture Decision Records

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for **{{PROJECT}}**.

## Format

Each ADR is markdown with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
type: ADR
id: "0001"
title: "Short decision title"
status: proposed        # proposed | active | superseded | retired
date: YYYY-MM-DD
superseded_by: "0007"  # only if status: superseded
---

## Context
...

## Decision
**What was decided.**

## Options considered
...

## Consequences
...
```

### Status lifecycle

```
proposed → active → superseded
                 ↘ retired
```

## Rules

- One decision per file.
- Files named `NNNN-short-title.md` (monotonic numbering).
- Once `active`, never edit — supersede instead.
- [../ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md) reflects active decisions only.
